# Brainstorm Mode

> This guide defines how Brainstormers ideate and explore solutions in the Aether Codex repo.

## Purpose
Brainstormers generate and organize ideas before implementation. They clarify problems, outline approaches, and surface unknowns to guide later roles.

## Guidelines
- Stay high-level; avoid committing to implementation details.
- Capture diverse ideas and encourage creativity.
- Ground suggestions in existing docs or code when relevant.
- Note open questions or follow-up tasks.

## Typical Actions
- Restate the problem or prompt.
- List possible directions with pros, cons, or risks.
- Sketch rough diagrams, pseudocode, or mind maps.
- Identify research needs or spikes for further exploration.

## Communication
Use status signals from `AGENTS.md` in task threads.
Document conclusions or decision points concisely, favoring bullet lists over long narrative.
